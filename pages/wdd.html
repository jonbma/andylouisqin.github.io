	<h1>Summary</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="http://wdd.io/">Web Design DeCal</a>, affectionately nicknamed "WDD", is the most popular student-taught class at UC Berkeley. We offer the most beginner-friendly entry point into web development, providing support along the way. I joined as an instructor for WDD in Fall 2014, when we received a whopping 905 applicants for the course, where we could only accept 100. My vision is that we would be the standard for learning web design for anyone with an internet connection.

	<h1>Key Metrics</h1>
	<p>
		<h2><i>Average Satisfaction Rating:</i> 4.9/5</h2>
		<h2><i>Average Increase in Confidence Level:</i> From 3 to 7</h2>
		<h2><i>Total Number of Applications:</i> 1964</h2>
	</p>

	<h1>How I Contributed</h1>
	<p>
		<b>Live Webcasts:</b> Every great university course has online infrastructure. I think WDD is a great course so naturally, I pushed hard for making all lectures and assignments available <a href="http://live.wdd.io/">to all.</a>
		<br><br>
		<b>Lectures:</b> Curated the content for lecture slides for all 12 weeks for the Programming side of the class. This was my first time not serving as a TA for a class, but as the actual instructor. Also tried to be funny in class and achieved a 50% laugh rate on jokes. That's pretty good for me.
		<br><br>
		<b>Practice:</b> Since securing the funding for having these webcasts, we realized that any errors or unpreparedness we had during class would be forever preserved for posterity on YouTube. This was a scary thought, so I thought the natural solution was to set up a simulation of class days for practicing our lectures and interactive demos beforehand. The effect of this is really seen in all the mistakes we didn't make on the recorded lecture.

	<h1>What I Learned</h1>

	<p>
		<b>Project Management:</b> It's not easy! During the summer when our rebuilding phase was on high, we were juggling around at least 8 different ideas that we thought would make WDD the class of the future. As time would have it, sometimes you just have to pick the 3 most important and table the rest for the future.
		<br><br>
		<b>Empathy:</b> You really have to be empathetic toward students in ways that seem counterintuitive. For example, asking the class for anything they don't understand and getting no responses doesn't mean you've done your job perfectly and achieved a 100% understanding rate. The reality is that admitting you don't understand in front of everyone is nervewracking, so you have to open channels to ask questions privately and anonymously, like Piazza.
		<br><br>
		<b>Team Culture:</b> I made the effort of arranging a retreat for the teaching staff of Team WDD. We went to the sunny beaches of Santa Cruz for a weekend getaway, and stayed in a hip beach house. As far as I know, teaching staffs typically don't go out for weekend trips together. but I wanted the team to understand that to make this class really special, we should bond first. I think it worked, our team meetings are full of jokes, sometimes to the detriment of productivity. Another good sign is that any mention of adding people to our team is taken with great consideration for culture fit.
