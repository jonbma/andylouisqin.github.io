	<h1>The Story</h1>
	<p>
		If you’re like me, when it’s time to study for finals in college, you do something else. So one day (4/21/13 according to Google Chat), I had an idea and pitched it to my best friend.

	<p>
		And after about half an hour of back-and-forth, we got really excited.

		Eventually it was settled. We were going to start a Web Development school in Arcadia, CA, geared toward students from the 7<sup>th</sup> to the 12<sup>th</sup> grades. Jon would handle the business end and I would build the <a href="http://codeprep.org/" target="_blank">website</a> and select my Spring 2013 classes to only be between Tuesday through Thursday. This left Monday and Friday to be days for traveling via Megabus to and from Arcadia (where we were hosting classes) and Berkeley (where I’m a student). I was looking at wonky class schedules like this one:

	<p>
		Pretty ridiculous right? Well it was. By the second week, I told Jon that I couldn’t keep up with all the traveling and trying to maintain passing grades. It was tough! In a last minute move, we found some trusted, locally-situated high school friends who were incredible at Web Development to take our curriculum and come teach in our place. Believe it or not, this worked for two iterations, before the non-scalability of hosting classes remotely caught up with us.

	<h1>What I Learned</h1>
	<p>
		<b>Know who you’re selling to.</b>
		<br><br>
		Our initial pitch for CodePrep was to sell it to students. All the language I wrote on the site started with exciting propositions like “<i>you</i> will learn to code in 6 weeks” or “<i>you</i> will have the skills to build your own website from scratch.” Our mistake was that while students could have been completely sold on learning to code, it was their parents we were supposed to be convincing. The maxim is that if I’m a parent, the only classes worth paying for are the ones that will help my kid get into Harvard. From this perspective, the $600 tuition for 6 weeks at CodePrep is an opportunity cost for the $2000+ tuition for SAT boot camps, and possibly for some weekend classes, since our classes were held in the afternoons on weekend days.
		<br><br>
		I can’t help but imagine a kid in 8th grade, super thrilled by the idea of learning how to do a bit of web development, but having her parents tell her that they should instead save their money for SAT prep classes. It’s heartbreaking to think about, so I’ll make sure to make this mistake again in my next venture.
		<br><br>
		<b>Education is all about accreditation.</b>
		<br><br>
		On a similar note, even though I had a few gigs of teaching computer science under my belt, it’s still going to be a tough sell. Parents wanted to see instructors with masters degrees and PhD’s, even though intuitively, I’d argue that to teach a beginner class in web development doesn’t require an advanced degree. What I think about this doesn’t matter though; what really matters was how many people on the fence about our experience could we convert to happy, paying customers. 
		<br><br>
		Perhaps we should have held some kind of demo to convince parents that we knew what we were talking about? We were initially playing with the idea of holding a large event to introduce ourselves, since my co-founder Jon said he found the most success in landing students for the class.
		<br><br>
		<b>Services are <i>much</i> harder to scale than products.</b>
		<br><br>
		I think this is pretty self-explanatory; Econ 1 and common sense say that services can’t be produced before the demand curve. In other words, there’s no way you can pre-package 100 CodePrep classes or 1,000 massage therapy sessions in advance. This is made especially hard when we're trying to do all of this remotely! In the future, I’d love to be working on a software product instead. Something where distribution isn’t something I really have to worry about, thanks to the Internet, and I can instead focus on making the best possible user experience.
		<br><br>
		I don’t regret a single moment of CodePrep. It was my first company, and we made mistakes, but if in the end we helped 15 kids realize how fun and powerful web development can be, then it was easily worth it.
