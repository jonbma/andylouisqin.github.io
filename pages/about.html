	<h1>All I've ever wanted to be in life is an original superhero.</h1>

	<p>
		To that end, I seek to develop technologies that need to happen for betterment of humanity. In particular, I'm a strong believer that <b>virtual reality</b> technologies will be the next big paradigm in computing, and I want to be a part of it. Just imagine a world in which online education is even more immersive as a brick-and-mortar classroom. Where would you want to go? Field trips to Ancient Greece or the inside of a plant cell are suddenly very practical. That's a future I want to contribute to.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm determinately optimistic about the future, meaning that I think that the future will be better than the past in definite ways. Besides virtual reality, I consider space exploration and computational genomics to be impending breakthroughs.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, I enjoy talking about the future, reading everything from science fiction to business strategy, and going running.
