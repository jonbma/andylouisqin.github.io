	<h2>Hi! I'm Andy.</h2>

	<p>
		All I've ever wanted to be in life is an original superhero.
	</p>

	<p>
		To that end, I seek to develop technologies that need to happen for betterment of humanity. I'm determinately optimistic about the future, and I'm currently working to make practical web programming accessible to anyone with an internet connection for free.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my free time, I love to talk about the future, read books on strategy, and go running.
